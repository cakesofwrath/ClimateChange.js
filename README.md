ClimateChange.js

[Our Koding URL](http://uckk8074e3f8.cakesofwrath.koding.io/ClimateChange.js/index.html)

Our submission as team cool_kid_alert for the 2014 Koding Hackathon.

Pretty messy code here. 

We used:
* [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)
* [planetary.js](http://planetaryjs.com/)
* [FileSaver.js](http://eligrey.com/blog/post/saving-generated-files-on-the-client-side/) - This was for messy data processing.
* Copious amounts of coffee.
